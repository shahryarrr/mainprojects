      <h2>Mortgage for First Time Buyers</h2>
      <p>
        Buying your first home is really exciting, but it can also be quite
        stressful. It’s a huge financial commitment and getting a mortgage is
        just one of many steps you’ll need to take before you can get your hands
        on the keys. Understanding what you need to do – and when – will make it
        much easier for you. Find out how to buy a house, how long it takes and
        how much it costs. And remember, people buy houses every day and you
        should get plenty of help from your mortgage broker and solicitor.
