      <h2>Mortgage for First Time Buyers</h2>
      <p>
        Buying your first home is really exciting, but it can also be quite
        stressful. It’s a huge financial commitment and getting a mortgage is
        just one of many steps you’ll need to take before you can get your hands
        on the keys. Understanding what you need to do – and when – will make it
        much easier for you. Find out how to buy a house, how long it takes and
        how much it costs. And remember, people buy houses every day and you
        should get plenty of help from your mortgage broker and solicitor.

    <h1>How to get a first time buyer mortgage</h1>
    <h2>Step 1 - Understanding your mortgage options</h2>
    <p>
      Once you've decided that the time is right for you to get on the property
      ladder, you can find and compare mortgages online and use Trussle's
      <b>mortgage calculator</b> to get a roguh idea of what you could borrow.
      Here's a quick summary of some of the mortgage types and repayment options
      you'll come across.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Fixed rate mortgage</b> fix your mortgage repayments until an agreed
        date, no matter what happens to interest rate
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tracker rate mortgage</b> are a type of variable rate mortgage. They
        follow the Bank of England base rate during a specified period, so your
        repayments can vary - go up or down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Capital repaymente</b> means taht each month you'll pay off some of
        what you've borrowed and some of the interest on the mortgage. if you
        keep your repayments up to date, at the end of the mortgage term you'll
        have paid off your mortgage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Interest-only repayment</b> means taht, you're only paying the
        interest on what you've borrowed. You'll be responsible for repaying the
        orginal amount you borrowed at the end of the mortgage term.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2 - Getting a Mortgage in Principle</h2>
    <p>
      A Mortgage in Principle is also known as a Decision or Agreement in
      Principle. It is an offical estiatme from a lender of how much you can
      afford to borrow on a mortgage and give you an idea how much you can
      afford to spend on your new home.
      <br /><br />
      The mortgage in principle is based on the initial personal details you
      provide about your employment status, income, how much you want to borrow
      and other factors, in combination with a credit check run against one of
      the UK credit reference agencies.An estate agent is likely to want to see
      it when you make an offer on a property. This is so that they can tell the
      seller you’ve got one when they pass on your offer to them.

      online from Trussle.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3 - Finding a property</h2>
    <p>
      Look online to see what homes you can afford and get in touch with the
      estate agent to arrange some viewings. Things to look into include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>School Catchment Areas</li>
      <li>Transport Links</li>
      <li>Local Infrastructure Plans</li>
      <li>Flood Zones</li>
      <li>Crime Levels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Make an offer when you find something that's right for you and your
      budget. Once a seller has accepted your offer, speak to your mortgage
      broker or lender. Either can help you find a mortgage, but a broker has a
      much bigger choice of deals than a lender. Trussle works with 90 lenders
      offering around 12,000 deals, for example. If you go directly to a lender,
      they'll only offer their own mortgages.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4 - Finding a Conveyancer or Property Solicitor</h2>
    <p>
      Conveyancing is the legal process that takes place after your offer is
      accepted. In England and Wales, this includes carrying out searches,
      drawing up and checking contracts, dealing with the Land Registry and
      paying any stamp duty.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 6 - Getting a Valuation</h2>
    <p>
      The lender will do a valuation of the property. This is to check what it’s
      worth in case they need to sell it if you do not pay your mortgage.The
      lender also needs to make sure that your new home meets certain rules set
      out in your mortgage. Speak to your broker if you’d like a more detailed
      survey done, such as a homebuyer’s report or a full structural survey.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 7 - Getting a Mortgage Offer</h2>
    <p>
      Once the lender has approved your mortgage application, they will send you
      the mortgage offer confirming that they will lend you a certain amount of
      money to buy the property you've chosen.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 8 - Exchanging Contracts with the Seller</h2>
    <p>
      Your solcitr will deal with all the legal aspect of your mortgage. This
      involves carrying out legal checks called enquiries and searches with the
      local authoiry and other bodies. Once the legal work has been completed,
      you can agree a completion date and exchange contracts with your seller.
      Your deal is now legally binding. On the compeltion date, your lender will
      release the funds for your mortgage and you are able to pick up the keys
      from the estate agent.
