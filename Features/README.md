## Planning

I used a notepad to jot down my ideas about this project - where on the page should I place the image carousel, how many cards to put, looked at different image carousels on Google for inspriation.

I look at other developers image carousels projects on GitHub for inspriation - I found @ImaginativeShohag on GitHubprojects helpful.
